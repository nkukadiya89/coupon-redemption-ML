# About the dataset
The following is a part of the description of the data:

1) ABC promotions are shared across various channels including email, notifications, etc. A number of these campaigns include      coupon discounts that are offered for a specific product/range of products. The retailer would like the ability to predict      whether customers redeem the coupons received across channels, which will enable the retailerâ€™s marketing team to accurately    design coupon construct, and develop more precise and targeted marketing strategies.
