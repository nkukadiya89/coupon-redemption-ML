                                           Recommendation system POC


# Installation Process

1) Download Anaconda distribution platform from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual (Your data science toolkit).

2) Install and Run Anaconda distribution.
   
    For windows : Directly from start menu
    for Linux : Anaconda-navigator

3) Make a virtual Environment for your POC you can make it from Anaconda navigator.

4) Download all the needed libraries for your project in your working environment.

5) Open jupyter notebook.


# About the dataset
The following is a part of the description of the data:

1) ABC promotions are shared across various channels including email, notifications, etc. A number of these campaigns include      coupon discounts that are offered for a specific product/range of products. The retailer would like the ability to predict      whether customers redeem the coupons received across channels, which will enable the retailerâ€™s marketing team to accurately    design coupon construct, and develop more precise and targeted marketing strategies.

2) The data available in this problem contains the following information, including the details of a sample of campaigns and        coupons used in previous campaigns 

                1) User Demographic Details
                2) Campaign and coupon Details
                3) Product details
                4) Previous transactions and more
                
3) Based on previous transaction & performance data from the last 18 campaigns, predict the probability for the next 10            campaigns in the test set for each coupon and customer combination,whether the customer will redeem the coupon or not?


# Working with POC

1) Data Understanding

    i) Reading of CSV file and understanding each
   ii) Check whattype of problem and datatype is there in data
    

2) Data Preparation

    i) After examinig all we need to prepare data for model purpose
   ii) This process include Mearging of tabels concatination of tabels and finding the aggrigation of data with tabels.
  iii) Finding the missing value and filling it is the most important step. 
  

3) Modeling Process
   
   i) After Data analysis done on each and every data we need to make a model or we can say that we need to apply the different       different algorithm on the train and test data to pridict data.
  ii) There are many algorithm in Machine learning. 
 iii) Broadly, there are so many types of Machine Learning Algorithms


                                    List of Common Machine Learning Algorithms
Here is the list of commonly used machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be applied to almost any data problem:

 1) Linear Regression
 2) Logistic Regression
 3) Decision Tree
 4) SVM
 5) Naive Bayes
 6) kNN
 7) K-Means
 8) Random Forest
 9) Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
 10) Gradient Boosting algorithms
 11) GBM
 12) XGBoost
 13) LightGBM
